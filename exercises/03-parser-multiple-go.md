# 🔄 Exercise 3: Multiple "go" Keywords - Parser Enhancement

In this exercise, you'll modify the Go parser to accept multiple consecutive "go" keywords for starting goroutines! 🚀 This will teach you how to enhance parser logic to handle repetitive syntax patterns while maintaining the same semantic behavior.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:

- ✅ Understand Go's parser structure and token consumption
- ✅ Know how to modify parser logic for syntax extensions
- ✅ Test parser modifications with working code

## 🔍 Step 1: Navigate to the Parser

```bash
cd go/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax
```

### 🔑 Understanding the Current Parser Logic

Let's examine how the parser currently handles the "go" statement in `parser.go`. Look around line 2675:

```go
// go/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/parser.go:2673-2676
...
return s

case _Go, _Defer:
    return p.callStmt()
...
```

The parser recognizes `_Go` token and immediately calls `p.callStmt()` to handle the goroutine creation.

Find the `callStmt()` method in `parser.go` at line 977. This is where we'll add our multiple "go" logic:

```go
// go/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/parser.go:976-985
// callStmt parses call-like statements that can be preceded by 'defer' and 'go'.
func (p *parser) callStmt() *CallStmt {
    if trace {
        defer p.trace("callStmt")()
    }

    s := new(CallStmt)
    s.pos = p.pos()
    s.Tok = p.tok // _Defer or _Go
    p.next()
    ...
}
```

The key line is `s.Tok = p.tok` which captures whether this is a "defer" or "go" statement, followed by `p.next()` which consumes the token.

## Step 2: Add Multiple "go" Support

We need to modify the `callStmt()` method to consume multiple consecutive "go" tokens while preserving the same semantic meaning.

**Edit `parser.go`:**

Find line 985 where `p.next()` is called and add our multiple "go" logic right after it:

```go
// go/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/parser.go:982-990
s := new(CallStmt)
s.pos = p.pos()
s.Tok = p.tok // _Defer or _Go
p.next()

// Allow multiple consecutive "go" keywords (go go go ...)
if s.Tok == _Go {
    for p.tok == _Go {
        p.next()
    }
}

...
```

### 🔧 Understanding the Code Change

- **`if s.Tok == _Go`**: Only apply multiple keyword logic to "go" statements (not "defer")
- **`for p.tok == _Go`**: Keep consuming "go" tokens while they appear consecutively
- **`p.next()`**: Advance past each additional "go" token
- **Preservation**: `s.Tok` remains `_Go`, so the semantic meaning is unchanged

## Step 3: Rebuild the Compiler

Now let's rebuild the Go toolchain with our changes:

```bash
cd ../../../  # back to go/src
./make.bash
```

If there are any compilation errors, review your changes and fix them.

## Step 4: Test Multiple "go" Keywords

Create a test program to verify our multiple "go" syntax works:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/multiple-go-test
cd /tmp/multiple-go-test
```

Create a test.go file:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sayHello(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hello from %s!\n", name)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Testing multiple go keywords...")

    // Test regular single go
    go sayHello("single go")

    // Test double go
    go go sayHello("double go")

    // Test triple go
    go go go sayHello("triple go")

    // Test quadruple go
    go go go go sayHello("quadruple go")

    // Wait a bit to see output
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Println("All done!")
}
```

Execute the test program with your custom Go:

```bash
/path/to/workshop/go/bin/go run test.go
```

You should see output like: ✨

```
Testing multiple go keywords...
Hello from single go!
Hello from double go!
Hello from triple go!
Hello from quadruple go!
All done!
```

## Step 5: Run Parser Tests

Let's make sure we didn't break the parser:

```bash
cd /path/to/workshop/go/src
../bin/go test cmd/compile/internal/syntax -short
```

## Understanding What We Did

1. **Parser Enhancement**: Modified `callStmt()` to handle multiple consecutive "go" tokens
2. **Token Consumption**: Added a loop to consume additional "go" tokens after the first one
3. **Semantic Preservation**: Multiple "go" keywords still create exactly one goroutine
4. **Targeted Change**: Only affects "go" statements, not "defer" statements

## 🎓 What We Learned

- 🔄 **Parser Logic**: How Go processes token sequences into statements
- 📝 **Token Consumption**: Techniques for consuming multiple tokens of the same type
- 🧪 **Parser Testing**: Validating parser changes with diverse test cases

## 💡 Extension Ideas

Try these additional modifications: 🚀

1. ➕ Add similar support for "defer defer defer" (more challenging!)
2. ➕ Add a maximum limit (e.g., max 5 consecutive "go" keywords)
3. 📊 Track how many "go" keywords were used for debugging
4. 🎨 Make the multiple keywords affect goroutine priority

## ➡️ Next Steps

Excellent work! 🎉 You've successfully enhanced Go's parser to handle repetitive syntax patterns.

In [Exercise 4: Compiler Inlining Parameters](./04-compiler-inlining-parameters.md), we'll shift focus to explore how Go's compiler optimization works, learning to tune inlining parameters for binary size control.

## Cleanup

To restore the original Go source:

```bash
cd /path/to/workshop/go/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax
git checkout parser.go
cd ../../../
./make.bash  # Rebuild with original code
```

## Summary

Multiple "go" keywords now work for starting goroutines:

```go
// These are all equivalent and create exactly one goroutine:
go myFunction()
go go myFunction()
go go go myFunction() 
go go go go myFunction()

// The parser consumes all consecutive "go" tokens
// but the semantic behavior remains the same!
```

This exercise demonstrated how parser-level modifications can add expressive syntactic sugar while preserving the underlying language semantics! 🚀✨
