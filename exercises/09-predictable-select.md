# 🎯 Exercise 9: Predictable Select - Making Select Statements Deterministic

In this exercise, you'll modify Go's `select` statement to be deterministic instead of random! 🎲➡️📏 By default, Go randomizes which case is chosen when multiple channels are ready. We'll change it to always choose cases in the same order.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:

- ✅ Understand how Go's `select` statement is implemented
- ✅ Know why Go uses randomization (fairness vs. starvation)
- ✅ Modify the runtime's channel selection algorithm
- ✅ Test deterministic vs. random selection behavior

## 🧠 Background: Go Randomizes Select

By default, when multiple channels are ready, Go randomizes which case executes:

```go
select {
case v := <-ch1:  // Sometimes chosen
case v := <-ch2:  // Sometimes chosen
case v := <-ch3:  // Sometimes chosen
}
// Random selection prevents starvation
```

We'll make it deterministic:

```go
select {
case v := <-ch1:  // ALWAYS chosen first when ready
case v := <-ch2:  // Only if ch1 not ready
case v := <-ch3:  // Only if ch1 and ch2 not ready
}
// Predictable, source-order selection
```

## 🔍 Step 1: Create a Test to See Current Randomization

Create a `random_select_demo.go` file:

```go
package main

func main() {
    ch1 := make(chan int, 1)
    ch2 := make(chan int, 1)
    ch3 := make(chan int, 1)

    // Fill all channels so they're all ready
    ch1 <- 1
    ch2 <- 2
    ch3 <- 3

    // Run select 10 times to see randomization
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        select {
        case v := <-ch1:
            println("Round", i, ": Selected ch1 (value", v, ")")
            ch1 <- 1 // Refill
        case v := <-ch2:
            println("Round", i, ": Selected ch2 (value", v, ")")
            ch2 <- 2 // Refill
        case v := <-ch3:
            println("Round", i, ": Selected ch3 (value", v, ")")
            ch3 <- 3 // Refill
        }
    }
}
```

Run with current Go to see random selection:

```bash
go run random_select_demo.go
```

Output shows random selection:
```
Round 0: Selected ch3 (value 3)
Round 1: Selected ch1 (value 1)
Round 2: Selected ch2 (value 2)
...
```

## Step 2: Navigate to the Select Implementation

```bash
cd go/src/runtime
```

The `select.go` file contains the entire select statement implementation. The key function is `selectgo()` which handles case selection.

## Step 3: Understand the Randomization Code

Look around line 191 in `select.go`:

```go
// go/src/runtime/select.go:191
j := cheaprandn(uint32(norder + 1))  // Random index!
pollorder[norder] = pollorder[j]
pollorder[j] = uint16(i)
norder++
```

This implements the algorithm to randomize case order:
- `cheaprandn()` generates a pseudo-random number
- Cases are placed in random positions in the `pollorder` array
- Select then checks cases in this randomized order

## Step 4: Make Select Deterministic

**Edit `select.go`:**

Find line 191 and change the randomization to be deterministic:

```go
// go/src/runtime/select.go:191
// Original:
j := cheaprandn(uint32(norder + 1))
pollorder[norder] = pollorder[j]
pollorder[j] = uint16(i)

// Change to:
pullorder[norder] = uint16(len(scases)-1-i)
```

### 🔧 Understanding the Code Change

- **`uint16(len(scases)-1-i)`**: Use inverse orther here
- **Result**: pullorder is now always ordered in the source code order
- **Effect**: Cases maintain their source code order in `pollorder`

## Step 5: Rebuild Go Runtime

```bash
cd ../  # back to go/src
./make.bash
```

## Step 6: Test Deterministic Behavior

```bash
../go/bin/go run random_select_demo.go
```

Now you should see **deterministic output**:

```
Round 0: Selected ch1 (value 1)
Round 1: Selected ch1 (value 1)
Round 2: Selected ch1 (value 1)
Round 3: Selected ch1 (value 1)
...
```

Perfect! `ch1` is **always** chosen because is the first one in the code, no more random order.

## Understanding What We Did

1. **Removed Randomization**: Replaced `cheaprandn()` with deterministic index
2. **Maintained Source Order**: Cases are now checked in the order they appear
3. **Performance Boost**: Slightly faster (no random number generation)
4. **Changed Semantics**: Same syntax, different runtime behavior

## 🎓 What We Learned

- 🔄 **Runtime Modification**: How to alter fundamental language behavior
- ⚖️ **Design Trade-offs**: Fairness vs. determinism in concurrent systems
- 📊 **Select Internals**: How `selectgo` and `pollorder` work
- 🧪 **Behavioral Testing**: Validating semantic changes with test programs

## 💡 Extension Ideas

Try these additional modifications: 🚀

1. ➕ Add a reverse-order mode (check cases last to first)
2. ➕ Add priority levels based on case position
3. 📊 Track selection statistics for debugging
4. 🎲 Make randomization configurable via environment variable

## Cleanup

To restore Go's original random behavior:

```bash
cd go/src/runtime
git checkout select.go
cd ../
./make.bash
```

## Summary

You've transformed Go's `select` from a fair, random chooser into a predictable, deterministic priority system:

```go
// Before: Random selection (fair but unpredictable)
select {
case <-ch1: // 33% chance
case <-ch2: // 33% chance
case <-ch3: // 33% chance
}

// After: Deterministic selection (predictable but may starve)
select {
case <-ch1: // Always chosen when ready
case <-ch2: // Only if ch1 not ready
case <-ch3: // Only if ch1 and ch2 not ready
}
```

This exercise demonstrated how runtime modifications can fundamentally change language behavior and exposed important trade-offs in concurrent system design! 🎯✨
