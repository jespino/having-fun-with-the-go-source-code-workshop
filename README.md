# 🚀 Having Fun with the Go Source Code Workshop

Welcome to an interactive workshop where you'll learn how to modify and experiment with the Go programming language source code! This hands-on workshop will guide you through understanding, building, and making changes to the Go compiler and runtime. 🎯

**📌 This workshop uses Go version 1.25.1** - we'll check out the specific release tag to ensure consistency across all exercises.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- 🐹 Basic knowledge of Go programming
- 💻 Familiarity with command line tools
- 🗂️ Git installed on your system
- **⚡ Go compiler version 1.24.6 or newer** (required for bootstrapping the build process)
- 💾 At least 4GB of free disk space

## 🎓 Workshop Overview

This workshop consists of 10 exercises that will take you through the process from building Go from source, and making modifications at different places in the compiler, tooling and runtime. You'll gain some insights about the Go internals, from things like the lexer or parser, to runtime behaviors:

### 🌱 [Exercise 0: Introduction and Setup](./exercises/00-introduction-setup.md)

Get started by cloning and setting up the Go source code environment.

### 🔨 [Exercise 1: Compiling Go Without Changes](./exercises/01-compile-go-unchanged.md)

Learn to build the Go toolchain from source without any modifications.

### ⚡ [Exercise 2: Adding the "=>" Arrow Operator for Goroutines](./exercises/02-scanner-arrow-operator.md)

Learn scanner/lexer modification by adding "=>" as an alternative syntax for starting goroutines.

### 🔄 [Exercise 3: Multiple "go" Keywords - Parser Enhancement](./exercises/03-parser-multiple-go.md)

Learn parser modification by enabling multiple consecutive "go" keywords (go go go myFunction).

### ⚙️ [Exercise 4: Inline Parameters - Function Inlining Experiments](./exercises/04-compiler-inlining-parameters.md)

Explore the inliner behavior by modifying function inlining parameters.

### 🎨 [Exercise 5: gofmt Transformation - "hello" to "helo"](./exercises/05-gofmt-ast-transformation.md)

Learn about Go's tools by modifying gofmt to modify "hello" to "helo" in code.

### 🔍 [Exercise 6: SSA Pass - Detecting Division by Powers of Two](./exercises/06-ssa-power-of-two-detector.md)

Create a custom SSA compiler pass that detects division operations by powers of two that could be optimized to bit shifts.

### 🕰️ [Exercise 7: Patient Go - Making Go Wait for Goroutines](./exercises/07-runtime-patient-go.md)

Modify the Go runtime to wait for all goroutines to complete before program termination.

### 🕵️‍♂️ [Exercise 8: Goroutine Sleep Detective - Runtime State Monitoring](./exercises/08-goroutine-sleep-detective.md)

Add logging to the Go scheduler to monitor goroutines going to sleep.

### 🎯 [Exercise 9: Predictable Select - Removing Randomness from Go's Select Statement](./exercises/09-predictable-select.md)

Modify Go's select statement implementation to be deterministic instead of random.

### ☕ [Exercise 10: Java-Style Stack Traces - Making Go Panics Look Familiar](./exercises/10-java-style-stack-traces.md)

Transform Go's verbose stack traces into Java-style formatting.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. 🌱 Start with [Exercise 0](./exercises/00-introduction-setup.md) to set up your environment
2. 📚 Work through the exercises in order
3. 🔗 After exercise 1, you can pick and choose the exercise that you want.

## 🌐 Website Generator

This repository includes a Go program that automatically generates a static website from the markdown exercise files.

### Generate the Website

```bash
# Using make (recommended)
make website

# Or run directly
cd website-generator
go run . -exercises ../exercises -output ../website
```

### Serve Locally

```bash
# Start a local web server
make serve

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

The website generator:
- ✅ Converts markdown to HTML using [blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday)
- ✅ Preserves all formatting, emojis, and code blocks
- ✅ Generates navigation between exercises
- ✅ Creates an index page with exercise overview
- ✅ Includes responsive CSS styling

See [website-generator/README.md](website-generator/README.md) for more details.

## 💡 Tips for Success

- ⏰ Take your time with each exercise - compiler internals are complex!
- 🔍 Don't hesitate to explore the Go source code beyond what's required
- 🌿 Use `git` to track your changes and revert when needed
- 🧪 Test your modifications thoroughly with various Go programs
